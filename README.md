This repository contains MATLAB scripts for modeling COVID-19 and seasonal flu and explore the effect of testing scenarios on estimating R0.

For model structure, see [Model_COVID_Flu.pdf](Model_COVID_Flu.pdf).

Model parameters can be changed in [COVID_parameters.m](COVID_parameters.m).

Transmission and testing scenarios can be modified in [Model_COVID_19_Sesaonal_Flu.m](Model_COVID_19_Sesaonal_Flu.m).

To run the model, open a MATLAB command window and run ```Model_COVID_19_Sesaonal_Flu```.
